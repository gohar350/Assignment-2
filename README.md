TASK 4
 OPEN SOURCE PROJECT
We choosed our open source project for task 4. 
                     FRAMEWORK THEY USED FOR TESTING
Framework they used for Api testing is Jestjs and SuperTest.
Framework they used for Ui testing is Nightwatch.

UI TESTING:

        NightWatch
    What is Nightwatch js used for?
Nightwatch. js is an integrated, easy to use End-to-End testing solution for web applications and websites, written in Node. js. It uses the W3C WebDriver API to drive browsers and perform commands and assertions on DOM elements.

What is the difference between Nightwatch and Selenium?
Nightwatchjs and Selenium can be primarily classified as "Browser Testing" tools. Nightwatchjs and Selenium are both open source tools. Selenium with 14.7K GitHub stars and 4.92K forks on GitHub appears to be more popular than Nightwatchjs with 9.38K GitHub stars and 917 GitHub forks.

Is Nightwatch js open-source?
For developers who use Nightwatch. js for their testing needs, Nightwatch will always remain free and open-source.



API TESTING:

        JEST.JS
    Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

It works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more!

        why Jest js is used:
Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly. Jest is well-documented, requires little configuration and can be extended to match your requirements.

        is jest better than other api Testers:
The test finished much faster than Jest, like because there were no variables to handle and no additions to be made. Jasmine is a powerful Javascript testing framework, especially when paired with Angular. Its testing language is a bit more intricate than Jest, which is why it's also great for backend testing
